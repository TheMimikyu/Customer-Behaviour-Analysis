# The Hidden Language of Consumers: Decoding Unseen Patterns
 
## Project Overview

> Note: OPCODE variant of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/OPCODE-Open-Spring-Fest/hidden-consumer-patterns).

### Objective

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and preferences. We aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform business strategies and enhance customer engagement.

### Methodology

To achieve our objective, we will employ the following analytical methods:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We will begin with EDA to understand the underlying structure of our data and to identify any interesting patterns or anomalies.
* **Univariate Analysis:** This will involve examining single variables to summarize and find patterns in the data.
* **Bivariate Analysis:** We will explore the relationship between two variables to understand the correlations and interactions between different customer attributes.
* **Unsupervised Learning Techniques:** We will use clustering algorithms to segment customers based on similar behaviors and preferences, which will help in targeting specific groups with tailored strategies.

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we anticipate the following outcomes:

* Identification of key customer segments.
* Insights into the preferences and behaviors of different customer groups.
* Recommendations for targeted marketing and product development strategies.
